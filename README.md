## About Pic-some

Pic some is taken from the [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/g/greact) course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

The code here may differs a fair amount from the original code in the course as I challenged myself to create this app without looking at the React code in the course. Since Bob is such a great teacher, once I copied the CSS and course folder structure I was able to write everything else from scratch. I also added some additional functionality.

Thanks to [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll?lang=en) for such a well taught course! Bob is an amazing teacher that promotes the importance of practice in his teaching philosophy. If you are new to React I promise you he will be worth every dime!
